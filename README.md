# GPU COMPUTE DRAFT

(Important) All these examples of programs with GPU have only been tested in:

OS
* Ubuntu Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS 64-bit

GPU
* Radeon rx 6500xt
* Radeon rx 6600

CPU
* ryzen 5700G

ROCM
* 6.2.2.60202-116~22.04

Other
* At the moment it mostly requires the explanation of the code and its final objectives (I seek to somehow justify a certain madness of the present code)
